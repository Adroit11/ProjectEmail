### Getting Started

The work to be done is to convert the contents of two(2) Figma design files into HTML email templates.

> It is important that you know that normal HTML is different from HTML for emails. However, fret not. A good chunk of your existing HTML knowledge still applies.

Figma design file 1 > https://www.figma.com/file/crVkECZ3V9eyomXeFZ7nQV/Make-reservation-(Hotel)
<br>
Figma design file 2 > https://www.figma.com/file/fzOLC1Ho13KeBf89LbZzmOFP/Issue-with-reservation-(Client)

### Contributing

You <strong>must</strong> create a new branch for every template you make. Your branch's name must follow the provided format in the table below.

| Branch name                              | Design                            | Who is working on it | Status     |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| template-make-reservation-prepaid        | Make reservation (Prepaid)        |                      | Unassigned |
| template-make-reservation-pay-on-arrival | Make reservation (Pay-on-arrival) |                      | Unassigned |
| template-issue-with-reservation          | Issue with reservation (Client)   |                      | Unassigned |

When you're done with the HTML email template, create a pull request. I will check that your template is responsive, matches the design and does not conflict with any other team mate's additions and then merge your branch with master.
