### Getting Started

The work to be done is to convert three(3) Figma design files into responsive HTML email templates.

> It is important that you know that normal HTML is different from HTML for emails. However, fret not. A good chunk of your existing HTML knowledge still applies.

#### Figma design file 1(https://res.cloudinary.com/mclint-cdn/image/upload/v1523521664/make_reservation_prepaid.svg)

#### Figma design file 2 (https://res.cloudinary.com/mclint-cdn/image/upload/v1523521676/Make_Reservation_Pay_on_arrival.svg)

#### Figma design file 3(https://res.cloudinary.com/mclint-cdn/image/upload/v1523522108/Issue_with_reservation_Client.png)

1.  You <strong>must</strong> create a new branch for every template you make. Your branch's name must follow the provided format in the table below.

| Branch name                              | Design                            | Who is working on it | Status     |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------- | ---------- |
| template-make-reservation-prepaid        | Make reservation (Prepaid)        |                      | Unassigned |
| template-make-reservation-pay-on-arrival | Make reservation (Pay-on-arrival) |                      | Unassigned |
| template-issue-with-reservation          | Issue with reservation (Client)   |  @nellybaz10         | Unassigned |

2.  In your newly created branch create a folder with a name that matches the branch name in the root folder and put your work inside there. Please do not touch anything else in the root folder.

3.  When you're done with the HTML email template, create a pull request. DM me in the #project-email channel @mclint\_, I will check that your template is responsive, matches the design and does not conflict with any other team mate's additions and then merge your branch with master.
